# Global Stability and Entropy Production for a Stochastic Neural Network Model
 A report submitted for the degree of MSc in Non-Equilibrium Systems

 Much of the current research in non-equilibrium systems seeks to classify the dynamical stability.
 Quantifying such stability continues to be a challenge. Herein, we explore a Hopfield-like neural
 network in the presence of noise under the probability-flux landscape formalism. We find several
 measures of stability through Lyapunov function that charactarize the global probability space.
 Furthermore, we quantify the extent of non-equilibrium behavior through the entropy production
 of the system in relation to dynamics on the landscape. Lastly, we attempt to derive an analytical
 expression for the steady-state probability distribution a priori from the interaction matrix in the
 case of a linear response function
